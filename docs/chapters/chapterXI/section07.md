<h2> XI.7 Invoking Function 3S  </h2>

After you have clicked on the ![GoatFunction>](/img/goat7.1.jpg "GOAT Function 3S") "3S" in the tool bar or the "Fn 3S" in the “Goat Function” list, the dialogue box displayed on the right will appear in your GOAT Window. To invoke Function 3S, you must enter either one or three street names. If you want to know the names of all streets that a particular street intersects, you would supply only a Borough and an ‘On’ Street. If you are only interested in the names of some of the streets that intersect the ‘On’ Street, you may restrict the output by supplying cross streets that will limit the output.  

The first street goes in the text box labeled “‘On’ Street”, the second street goes in the text box labeled “First Cross Street” and the third street goes in the text box labeled “Second Cross Street”. You may not supply a “First Cross Street” unless you supply a “Second Cross Street”. The converse is also true. Place Names may not be used. You select the borough by clicking on one of the buttons associated with “Borough of 'On' Street Name”. The borough names are abbreviated. Mn is Manhattan, Bx is the Bronx, Bk is Brooklyn, Qn is Queens and SI is Staten Island. The dialogue box appears with the borough pre-set to Manhattan.  

The dialogue box on the right ![GoatFunction>](/img/goat7.2.jpg "GOAT Function 3S") requests all of the streets that intersect Reade Street in Manhattan. The output would appear as shown on the top of the next page. Please note that the output includes the approximate length of the street stretch.

<span> If you are only interested in a subset of the streets that ntersect the ‘On’ Street, you may limit your search by specifying cross streets as illustrated in the dialogue box to the right. The output of this search will yield the results shown below.</span>

If the ‘on’ street and one or both of the cross streets ![GoatFunction>](/img/goat7.6.jpg "GOAT Function 3S_StreetSubsets") intersect twice, you must specify a compass direction. In the example shown here, the street stretch being requested is Alderton Street between its northern intersection with Cromwell Crescent and its southern intersection with Cromwell Crescent. The output is shown below.
