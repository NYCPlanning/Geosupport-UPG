To invoke Function 1 or 1E, you must enter a house number in the text box labeled “House Number” and a street name in the text box labeled “Street Name”. If you want information about a place name such as the Bronx Zoo or the Empire State Building, then you enter the place name in the text box labeled “Street Name” and leave the text box labeled “House Number” blank. You select the borough by clicking on one of the buttons associated with “Borough”. The borough names are abbreviated. Mn is Manhattan, Bx is the Bronx, Bk is Brooklyn, Qn is Queens and SI is Staten Island. The dialogue box appears with the borough pre-set to Manhattan. You may choose to receive or not to receive information concerning the political districts (Function 1E), such as Election District, Assembly District, etc  

The input and the output are displayed as below. In this example the political districts are displayed.
