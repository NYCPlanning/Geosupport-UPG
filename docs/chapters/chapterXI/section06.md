<h2> XI.6 Invoking Function 3 or Function 3C  </h2>

After you have clicked on "3" in the tool bar or "Fn 3"  ![GoatFunction>](../../../img/goat6.1.jpg "GOAT Function 2") in the “Goat Function” list, the dialogue box displayed on the right will appear in your GOAT Window. To invoke Function 3 or 3C, you must enter three street names. The first goes in the text box labeled “‘On’ Street”, the second goes in the text box labeled “First Cross Street” and the third goes in the text box labeled “Second Cross Street”. Place Names may not be used. You select the borough by clicking on one of the buttons associated with “Borough of 'On' Street Name”. The borough names are abbreviated. Mn is Manhattan, Bx is the Bronx, Bk is Brooklyn, Qn is Queens and SI is Staten Island. The dialogue box appears with the borough pre-set to Manhattan. You do not need to click on a button associated with “Borough of First Cross Street” or “Borough of Second Cross Street” if all three streets are in the same borough.
