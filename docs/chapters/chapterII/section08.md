<h2> II.8 Creating a Geosupport Desktop Edition Application  </h2>

The Geosupport library (NYCgeo.lib) must be made available to the languages that require it, viz. C/C++.  

The C/C++ header files (NYCgeo.h and pac.h) should be included in made available for C/C++ programs.  

See sample programs in [Chapter II.9](../../chapterII/section09) for more detail.  

The internal Geosupport data files are automatically defined as environment variables during installation of Geosupport Desktop Edition. No action is required by the user.
