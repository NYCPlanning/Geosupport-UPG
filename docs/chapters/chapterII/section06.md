<h2>II.6 The Work Area C/C++ Header File and Visual Basic Typedef File </h2>

The source code layouts of all the Geosupport API work areas appear in a header file for C/C++ <span class="customPre">(pac.h)</span> and a typedef file for Visual Basic <span class="customPre">(vbwadef.bas).</span> These files may be found in <br> <span class="customPre">c:\program files\Geosupport Desktop Edition\include </span>  

Use of these files is strongly recommended. A listing of the files appear in Appendix 5. A text
description of the work area layouts is provided in Appendix 2.  

For C/C++, [Chapter II.7](../../chapterII/section07) describes the specific source code statements that users must code in their programs to utilize the Geosupport header file. See sample C/C++ program for what is
required to compile a program that utilizes the Geosupport header file.
