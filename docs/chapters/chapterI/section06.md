<h2>I.6 Technical References</h2>  

For detailed information refer to the *Geosupport System User Programming Guide*. This section will discuss those elements where the information on the mainframe is different than when you are using Geosupport Desktop Edition.  


<h5><u>I.6.1 Street Names</u></h5>  
Refer to [Chapter III](../chapterIII/chapterIII/) in the *Geosupport System User Programming Guide*. There is no difference for Street Names between Geosupport on the mainframe and Geosupport Desktop Edition.  

<h5><u>I.6.2 Street Codes</u></h5>  
Refer to [Chapter IV](../chapterIV/chapterIV/) in the *Geosupport System User Programming Guide*. Ignore any discussion of “PB5SC”, which is a special form of the street codes used only on the mainframe.  

<h5><u>I.6.3 Address Processing</u></h5>  
Refer to [Chapter V](../chapterV/chapterV/) in the  *Geosupport System User Programming Guide*. In Geosupport Desktop Edition, the House Number in Internal Format (HNI) is not used. In its place the House Number in Sort Format (HNS) is used. The HNI is a 6 byte field and may be used in mainframe applications. The HNS is an 11 byte field. When reading Chapter V in the *Geosupport System User Programming Guide*, substitute HNS whenever HNI is referenced.  

<h5><u>I.6.4 Tax Lot and Building Processing</u></h5>  
Refer to [Chapter VI](../chapterVI/chapterVI/) in the *Geosupport System User Programming Guide* for detailed information on this subject. However ignore [Chapter VI.8](../chapterVI/section08/), which discusses the Standard and Legacy version of Functions 1A and BL. The Legacy version is not available in Geosupport Desktop Edition.  

<h5><u>I.6.5 Street Configuration Processing</u></h5>   
Refer to [Chapter VII](../chapterVII/chapterVII/) in the *Geosupport System User Programming Guide* for detailed information on this subject.
