<p>This Data Item Dictionary is an alphabetical list of the data items for which there are fields in the Geosupport API work areas, together with descriptive information.  In general, data items are listed in this appendix under the names used in the work area layouts in <a href="../../appendices/appendix02/">Appendix 2 (MSW)</a> and <a href="../../appendices/appendix13/">Appendix 13 (COW)</a>.  However, if an item is associated with multiple work area fields having varying field names, and is identical in format and range of values in all those fields, the item is documented in a generically-named entry, and there is also a separate entry for each of those fields consisting only of a reference to the generic entry.  For example, there is a generic entry for CENSUS TRACT containing full descriptive information, and there are also entries for 2000 CENSUS TRACT, LEFT 2000 CENSUS TRACT, RIGHT 2000 CENSUS TRACT, 2010 CENSUS TRACT etc., containing only a reference to the entry for CENSUS TRACT.</p>
<p>Each entry consists of an appropriate combination of the following elements:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><u>Name of Data Item.</u>  This might be identical to the name of a specific work area field or it might be a generic name for a data item that is represented by multiple work area fields.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><u>Field Names.</u>  A list of the field names associated with a generic entry.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><u>Function(s).</u>  A list of the Geosupport functions that utilize this data item as either an input or an output item in either WA1 or WA2.  If the data item is in the added portion of WA2 that is passed when the function is called with the long WA2 option, this is so stated.  Similarly, if the data is passed when the function is called with an Extended or Auxiliary or other option, it is so stated. In the list of functions, an asterisk in the second position of a function code is a ‘wild card’ signifying all functions having the indicated value in the first position, as follows:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<div class="indent">
  <p>1 * = 1, 1A, 1B, 1E, 1N; also 1Extended, 1A Extended, 1E Extended</p>
  <p>2 * = 2, 2W</p>  
  <p>3 * = 3, 3C, 3S, 3 & 3C with Auxiliary Segments, 3 & 3C Extended (with or without Auxiliary Segments)</p>  
  <p>B * = BB, BF, BL, BN</p>  
  <p>D * = D, DG, DN</p>
</div>

<ul>
<li>
<p><u>Work Area Format:</u> A list of the work area format(s) that apply to this entry, namely,  MSW (Mainframe-Specific Work Area) and/or COW (Character-Only Work Area).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><u>Length and Format.</u>  The length of this data item in bytes, and a description of its format, including whether it is numeric, alphabetic or alphanumeric (these terms are defined below);  whether it contains any special editing characters;  and for numeric items, the justification and the fill character.  The following terms and abbreviations are used:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>RJ = Right-Justified<br />
LJ = Left-Justified<br />
ZF = Zero-Filled<br />
BF = Blank-Filled</p>
<p><b>Numeric:</b> Contains only the digits 0 through 9, and possibly blanks serving as fill characters only.<br />
<b>Alphabetic:</b> Contains letters of the alphabet only.  LJBF unless otherwise stated.<br />
<b>Alphanumeric:</b> Can contain any allowable characters, including special characters such as hyphens.  LJBF unless otherwise stated.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><u>Description.</u>  A brief narrative description of the data item.  The description may include citations to sections of the UPG where the data item is principally discussed.  Data items that are self‑explanatory have no description and/or citations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><u>Valid Values and Code Meanings.</u>  The values or ranges of values valid for this data item and, if the item consists of codes, the meaning of each code value.  </p>
</li>
</ul>

        <td>An ‘address range’ is a sequence of house numbers along an ‘on’ street between (and including) a Low House Number and a High House Number.  Every address range has one of three possible parities: odd, even or continuous.  An address range of odd parity consists of all odd house numbers along the ‘on’ street between the Low and High House Numbers.  An even-parity range consists of all even house numbers between the Low and High House Numbers.  A continuous-parity range consists of all house numbers (both even and odd) between the Low and High House Numbers.  Most New York City blockfaces contain an address range that is either of even or odd parity.  However, some blockfaces have a continuous-parity address range, usually where the opposite side of the street is non-addressable because it is a park, a body of water, etc.  Some examples of the continuous parity case in Manhattan are Central Park West (the east side of the street runs along Central Park and is non-addressable, while the west side has both odd and even addresses);  Riverside Drive;  and the portion of Fifth Avenue that runs alongside Central Park. <br><br> If a New York City blockface has a continuous parity address range, Geosupport represents this range as two separate ranges, an odd-parity range and an even-parity range.  The practical effect of this depends on the Geosupport function.  For Functions 1 and 1E, if an input address lies on a continuous-parity blockface, only the range (i.e., the Low and High House Numbers) whose parity is the same as that of the input address is returned in WA2.  For Function 3, if an input street segment contains a continuous parity address range, both the odd and the even ranges are returned, in the WA2 fields called Left Low House Number and Left High House Number for the range of one parity, and in the fields Right Low and High House Numbers for the range of the other parity;  note that in this case, in reality both the odd and the even ranges are on the same side of the street, even though they are returned in fields called ‘left’ and ‘right’.  For Function 3C, if an input blockface is on a street segment containing a continuous parity address range (regardless of whether the input blockface is on the addressable or the non-addressable side of the segment), both the odd and the even ranges are returned, in the WA2 fields called Low House Number and High House Number for the range of one parity, and in the fields Alternate Low House Number and Alternate High House Number for the range of the other parity.  <br><br> The field Continuous Parity Indicator indicates, for Functions 1, 1E, 3 and 3C, whether the street segment containing or corresponding to the user input is of the continuous parity type, and if so, which side of the segment is addressable.</td>

<br>Note 1: In order to provide the user with the most meaningful information, ‘normal’ streets will be listed first, followed by ‘special’ streets, such as Ramps and Exits. Railroads, Shorelines and Borough Boundaries will appear next, followed by Named Intersections, CITY LIMITs, DEAD ENDs and BENDs. This will occur even if the ‘special’ streets have lower street codes than the ‘normal’.
<br>Note 2: To avoid unnecessary listing of BENDs, Function 3S lists a BEND only if the angle of the bend is 60 degrees or more.  (Prior to Release 16D, a bend was listed if the angle was 20 degrees or more.)  Also, a bend is not included in the list of cross streets when another real street intersects there as well.
<br>Note 3: Since Function 3S returns B7SCs, it is now possible for two streets to have the same B5SCs and different B7SCs, e.g. in Brooklyn, at the intersection of Clinton Street with Livingston Street and Aitken Place, Livingston Street and Aitken Place have the same B5SC (3-56530) but different B7SCs (3-56530-01 and 3-56530-02 respectively).</td>

Except for a special case (alternative borough for Marble Hill and Rikers Island - see <a href="../../chapters/chapterV/section07/">Chapter V.7</a>), if the input address is a real address, the first group of entries in the LGI are those for the BIN corresponding to the input address, and (except for alternative street records for Ruby Street - see <a href="../../chapters/chapterV/section08/">Chapter V.8</a>) the address range encompassing the input address is the very first entry in the LGI.  After all the entries with non-empty BINs are listed, any entries with empty BINs, such as entries for pseudo-address ranges, are listed in no particular order as space allows.  If the input address is a pseudo-address range, it may or may not appear in the LGI, depending on space and on the order in which the non-BIN entries happen to be listed.</p>

      <td>Except for curved segments <b>(see Curve Flag)</b>, the Segment Length is computed from the <b>Spatial Coordinates</b> of the segment’s endpoints, as digitized in the LION file.  For curved segments, the Segment Length is computed by summing the lengths of the small straight line segments that approximate the curve in the GIS version of LION; this is a more accurate approximation to the true arc length of the curve than would be the segment’s ‘secant length’, that is, the straight line distance between the curve’s extreme endpoints.  In the case of Functions 3 and 3C, if the input data define a street stretch encompassing more than one segment (because of a T-intersection or bend), the Segment Length returned is the sum of the lengths of the constituent segments of the stretch.  Similarly for Functions 1 and 1E, if the input lies on a segment that is generated from multiple segments, the Segment Length returned is the sum of the lengths of the constituent segments.  In all cases, the Segment Length has a very approximate level of accuracy only, and <u>should not be used in applications requiring high precision.</u> </td>

Spatial coordinates are often used in conjunction with separate computer mapping and Geographic Information System (GIS) software to generate maps and for spatial analysis, although the Geosupport System does not itself provide users with such capabilities.  <b><u>Note: For Functions 1, 1B (blockface information) and 1E, the spatial coordinates that Geosupport returns are imprecise approximations of real-world locations, and are not appropriate for use in applications that require a high level of spatial accuracy.</u></b> </td>

      <td>Spatial coordinates are expressed various geodetic coordinate systems, of which latitude/longitude is a well-known example.  The coordinate system that Geosupport uses is known as the State Plane Coordinate (SPC) system.  The SPC system is based upon the fact that, in a small enough geographic area, the earth’s surface can be assumed to be flat without introducing a significant error.  In the SPC system, each state of the U.S. is subdivided into zones small enough to model as planar areas.  In each SPC zone, a Cartesian coordinate system is established, with the X and Y coordinate axes oriented due east and due north, respectively, and the origin selected to be a point well to the southwest of the entire zone.  (The origin is so selected to insure that the X and Y coordinates of all points within the zone are positive values.)  The SPC zone that New York City is in, and which Geosupport uses, is called the New York-Long Island zone, NAD 83.  In the SPC system, one unit of X or Y represents one foot of distance on the ground.  A major advantage of the SPC system over other map projection systems is the ease of calculating the distance between two points.</td>

The coordinates associated with the Tax Lot Centroid are guaranteed to be within the property, unlike the coordinates returned by either Function 1 or Function 1E, where the Spatial Coordinates are an approximation based in the address range of the particular street the address is on.  In addition, the Function 1/1E Spatial Coordinates always fall in the street bed and not within a tax lot, and most likely will not be adjacent to the tax lot the address is in.  Additionally, when using Function 1A, the same coordinates will be returned no matter which of a tax lot’s addresses is used as input.  There are a few properties which do not have a Tax Lot Centroid; consequently, no coordinates will be returned for these properties.</td>
